# MatchMaker

MatchMaker is a simple web app that proposes matchups between two teams of players.  I wrote it for two main reasons: 1) We play team-based LAN games where I work and we need a way to quickly pick fair teams, and 2) I had been out of the web development game for a while and wanted to explore some technologies I hadn't used yet, like [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/).

MatchMaker was originally developed in Subversion and later moved to GitHub, hence the lack of history.  

Special thanks go out to [bxyoung89](https://github.com/bxyoung89/) and [thebrux](https://github.com/thebrux) for their contributions to this project.

## Backlog

- Move backlog from readme to GitHub issue database
- Load settings from disk
- Don't show games that the current user doesn't play (or show them in a different section)
- Only use one decimal place of precision
- Need a space between win/loss percent and record
- Notify/highlight when your ratings for a player have expired
- Rename View Data
- Win/loss record is showing for all games (not just the selected game)
- Create a favicon
- Leverage new HTML5 attributes, ie: email input type, placeholder attribute, validation required, etc
- Move from IIS to Nancy self-hosted
- Copy to clipboard doesn't work in Steam
